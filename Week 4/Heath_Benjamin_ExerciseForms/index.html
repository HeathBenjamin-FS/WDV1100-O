          <p>
            Modern disc golf started in the early <strong>1960s</strong>, but there is debate over
            who came up with the idea first. The consensus is that multiple groups of people played
            independently throughout the 1960s. Students at Rice University in Houston, Texas, for
            example, held tournaments with trees as targets as early as 1964, and in the early
            1960s, players in Pendleton King Park in Augusta, Georgia, would toss Frisbees into
            50-gallon barrel trash cans designated as targets. In 1968 Frisbee Golf was also played
            in Alameda Park in Santa Barbara, California, by teenagers in the Anacapa and Sola
            street areas. Gazebos, water fountains, lamp posts, and trees were all part of the
            course. This took place for several years and an Alameda Park collectors edition disc
            still exists, though rare, as few were made. Clifford Towne from this group went on to
            hold a National Time Aloft record.

            Ed Headrick, also known as "Steady" Ed Headrick, (June 28, 1924 – August 12, 2002) was
            an American toy inventor. He is most well known as the father of both the modern-day
            Frisbee and of the sport and game of disc golf. In 1975, Headrick's tenure at Wham-O
            where he helped redesign the flying disc known as the frisbee ended, and ties between
            Headrick and Wham-O eventually split. Headrick left the company to start out on his own
            to focus all his efforts on his new interest, which he coined and trademarked "Disc
            Golf" In 1976, "Steady" Ed Headrick and his son Ken Headrick started the first disc golf
            company, the Disc Golf Association (DGA).[6] The purpose of DGA was to manufacture discs
            and baskets and to formalize the sport. The first disc golf target was Ed's pole hole
            design which consisted of a pole sticking out of the ground.

            The sport of disc golf is set up similar to a game of golf. A "round" is played on a
            disc golf course consisting of a number of "holes", usually 9 or 18.[16] Each hole
            includes a tee position for starting play and a disc golf target some distance away,
            often with obstacles such as trees, hills or bodies of water in between.[17] Players
            begin by throwing a disc from the tee, without crossing over the front of the tee prior
            to releasing the disc when throwing. This could lead to a fault similar to a bowling
            foot fault in cricket. Players then navigate the hole by picking up the disc where it
            comes to rest and throwing again until they reach the target. The object of the game is
            to get through the course with the lowest number of total throws.[18] Play is usually in
            groups of five or fewer, with each player taking turn at the tee box, then progressing
            with the player furthest from the hole throwing first, while the other players stand
            aside. Each course is unique, and so requires a different combination of throws to
            complete, with the best players aiming to shape the flight of the disc to account for
            distance, terrain, obstacles and weather. In order to facilitate making different shots,
            players carry a variety of discs with different flight characteristics, choosing an
            appropriate disc for each throw. Some players also carry a mini marker disc, used to
            accurately mark the throwing position before each throw. Use of mini marker discs is
            particularly prevalent in formal competitive play. Many courses include out-of-bounds
            areas, commonly called "OB zones" or just "OB". If the disc lands in these areas, the
            player is usually required to add a penalty throw onto their score and continue play
            from near where the disc entered the out-of-bounds zone. Some courses include
            out-of-bounds areas with special rules requiring the player to resume play from a
            specified area called a drop zone or requiring the player to restart the hole from the
            tee. Some courses also include Mandatories (also called "Mandos") which require the path
            of the disc to be above, below or to one side of a specific line indicated by a sign. By
            tradition, players throw from the tee box in the order of their score on the previous
            hole, with the lowest scorer throwing first. Most players also follow a loose code of
            courtesy while playing, which includes norms such as standing out of the sight line of
            the throwing player and avoiding making distracting noises. Because a thrown disc could
            injure someone, the Professional Disc Golf Association recommends that players "Never
            throw into a blind area or when spectators, pedestrians or facility users are within
            range."[19] Formal competitive play is governed by the PDGA Official Rules of Disc Golf
            and the PDGA Competition Manual for Disc Golf events.

          <p>
            Disc golf discs are smaller than Ultimate flying discs or general-purpose recreational
            frisbees. They typically measure 21–22 cm (8.3–8.7 in) in diameter and weigh 130–180 g
            (4.6–6.3 oz). All PDGA-approved discs measure 21–30 cm (8.3–11.8 in) in diameter and
            weigh no more than 200 g (7.1 oz). Discs used for disc golf are designed and shaped for
            control, speed, and accuracy, while general-purpose flying discs, such as those used for
            playing guts or ultimate, have a more traditional shape, similar to a catch disc. There
            is a wide variety of discs used in disc golf and they are generally divided into three
            categories: drivers, mid-range discs, and putters.

          <ul class="discs">

              <h3 class="gradient-border">Driver</h3>
              <p>
                Drivers are recognized by their sharp, beveled edge and have most of their mass
                concentrated on the outer rim of the disc rather than distributed equally
                throughout. They are optimized for aerodynamics and designed to travel maximum
                distances at high speeds. They are typically thrown by experienced players during
                tee-off and other long distance fairway throws. [20] Some disc brands further
                sub-divide their drivers into different categories. For example, Innova has Distance
                Drivers and Fairway Drivers, with a fairway driver being somewhere between a
                distance driver and a mid-range disc. Discraft has three categories of drivers: Long
                Drivers, Extra Long Drivers, and Maximum Distance Drivers. Another type of driver,
                used less frequently, is a roller. As the name indicates, it has an edge designed to
                roll rather than fly. (Although any disc can be used for a roller, some behave quite
                differently than others). The world record distance for a disc golf throw is held by
                David Wiggins Jr., with a distance of 1,108.92 ft (338.00 m) on March 28, 2016.[21]
                He broke the previous record of 863.5 ft (263.2 m), thrown by Simon Lizotte on
                October 25, 2014.[22]

            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="gradient-border">Mid-range</h3>
              <p>
                Mid-range discs feature a dull, beveled edge and a moderate rim width. They offer
                more control than drivers, but they have a smaller range. Mid-range discs are
                typically used as approach discs. Beginner players will often use mid-ranges instead
                of drivers at tee-off, as they require less strength and technique to fly straight
                than higher speed drivers.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3 class="gradient-border">Putter</h3>
              <p>
                Putters are designed to fly straight, predictably, and very slowly compared to
                mid-range discs and drivers. They are typically used for tight, controlled shots
                that are close to the basket, although some players use them for short drives where
                trees or other obstacles come into play. Additionally, higher speed discs will not
                fly properly without a fast enough release snap, so a putter or mid-range with lower
                snap requirements is more forgiving and will behave in a more regular way.
                Professional players often carry multiple putters with varying flight
                characteristics.
